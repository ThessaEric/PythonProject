• Data pre processing : We are going to use several
methods to detect and delete/replace the
outliers in our dataset, in order to apply the
machine learning models in a clean dataset.
• Data visualization : The importance of data
visualization is simple, it helps people see,
interact with, and better understand data.
Whether simple or complex, the right
visualization can bring everyone on the same
page, regardless of their level of expertise.
• Modeling : We can use whether regression or
classification. Depends of the target.
Furthermore it is possible play with the
hyperparameters to improve our model.
• Django : The django framework is a dynamic
application used to create a showcase for
analyzing and visualizing the data studied in the
notebook.
